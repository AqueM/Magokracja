Pełna [[Melodia]], odbicie [[Ciaran Conejero]]. Przybiera formę dziecka. 


Hope is a weapon
hope is a skill
hope is a plant you care for or kill
hope is a discipline
something you choose
hard to stop looking for, easy to lose
if you can’t find it, it’s something you make
make it from will power, make it from spite
learn to weaponize love in a fight
hope is a shield and a thing to defend
end in itself and means to an end
